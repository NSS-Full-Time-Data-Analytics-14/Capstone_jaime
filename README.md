## Motivation:
In the past year I made the biggest decision of my life in buying my first house. Davidson County was where I decided to settle down and so far I've been happy with my decision. Looking to make a major financial decision like buying or moving into a home can be very difficult and a lot of research is necessary. With my capstone, I hope to make that decision easier for next person considering moving into Davidson County.
