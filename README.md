## Motivation:
In the past year I made the biggest decision of my life in buying my first house. Davidson County was where I decided to settle down and so far I've been happy with my decision. Looking to make a major financial decision like buying or moving into a home can be very difficult and a lot of research is necessary. With my capstone, I hope to make that decision easier for next person considering moving into Davidson County.
Interest Points:
- Housing Market
- Weather
- Population
- Employment
- Development



## Questions:
1) How much does it cost to purchase a property in the city of Nashville?
2) Is Davidson County diverse? Is there a healthy mix of ancestral backgrounds?
3) What kind of job industries are succesful in the area?
4) Where does most of the working population land in income level?
5) How does Davidson County compare to Shelby, Knox, and Fulton?
6) Is the traffic bad? How do we solve this issue?




## Problems and Hurdles
I think the first obstacle I ran into was figuring out where and what kind of data I wanted to find. I found myself spending a lot of my time cleaning up data and making it useful. I took time to really understand what my data meant rather than just preparing/presenting it. This was done overtime, the more I worked with the data the more I understood what it meant and what unit or titles/values were necessary. I expect the time limit to be a constraining. I will need to have a good amount of paraphrashing or glancing over some visuals to stay within the time limit but also need to say enough to make sure my audience has good take aways from everything.
